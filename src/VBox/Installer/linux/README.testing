This file documents things which need testing when updating the Linux host
installers or anything which might indirectly affect them.  This should be
updated as we discover new things which could break.

 * Test building, installing and running the run, RPM and Debian packages.
 * Test removing the packages - any errors?  Any files left behind?  Can the
   package be re-installed and run after removal?
 * Test upgrading them from any version we are likely to want to upgrade from.
   Make sure we can start.
 * Make sure that RPM/deb packages will not install if the run package is
   installed and vice-versa.
