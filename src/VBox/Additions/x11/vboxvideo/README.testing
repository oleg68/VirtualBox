This file contains some notes about things to try out to give the X.Org video
driver a reasonably thorough test.  We will add cases of things which have been
known to fail in the past to this file as we discover them.

 * Test XFree86 guests (CentOS 3), early X.Org (CentOS 5) and recent
   (CentOS 6 and 7, current Ubuntu/Fedora).  Test Solaris guests (10 and 11?).
 * Dynamic resizing with and without VBoxClient running.  The driver will
   currently always use HGSMI for mode hints, but should check data sent by
   VBoxClient.  On Solaris guests, dynamic resizing is only expected to
   react immediately if VBoxClient and the kernel driver are running.
 * Disabling and enabling virtual screens.
 * Dynamic resizing with one of more virtual screens disabled.
 * Test switching to virtual terminals and back from windowed, full screen and
   seamless modes.
 * Test enabling and disabling guest screens from the host.
 * execute "xprop -root | grep VBOX" after resizing a screen: VBOX_SIZE_HINTS
   should be set, and VBOX_SIZE_HINTS_MISMATCH should equal 0.
 * Shutting down and re-starting a virtual machine should restore the last size
   for all monitors (note: currently only after log-in).
