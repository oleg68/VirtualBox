This file contains some notes about things to try out to give the X.Org video
driver a reasonably thorough test.  We will add cases of things which have been
known to fail in the past to this file as we discover them.

 * Test XFree86 guests (CentOS 3), early X.Org (CentOS 5) and recent
   (CentOS 6 and 7, current Ubuntu/Fedora).  Test Solaris guests (10 and 11?).
 * Dynamic resizing should work, on CentOS 6 and later Linux guests it should
   work without VBoxClient running.
 * Disabling and enabling virtual screens (only possible as of 4.4).
 * Dynamic resizing with one of more virtual screens disabled.
 * Test switching to virtual terminals and back from windowed, full screen and
   seamless modes.
 * Test switching directly between normal, full-screen, seamless and scaled
   modes.
 * Test enabling and disabling guest screens from the host.
 * execute "xprop -root | grep VBOX" after resizing a screen: VBOX_SIZE_HINTS
   should be set, and VBOX_SIZE_HINTS_MISMATCH should equal 0 on CentOS 6 and
   later.
 * Shutting down and re-starting a virtual machine should restore the last size
   for all monitors (note: currently only after log-in).
